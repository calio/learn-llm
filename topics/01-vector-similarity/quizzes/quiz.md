# Quiz: Vector Similarity

1) Which metric is scale-invariant with respect to vector magnitudes?
   - A. Euclidean distance
   - B. Manhattan distance
   - C. Cosine similarity
   - D. Chebyshev distance

2) If two vectors are orthogonal, cosine similarity equals:
   - A. −1
   - B. 0
   - C. 0.5
   - D. 1

3) Which metric measures the maximum coordinate-wise difference?
   - A. L2 (Euclidean)
   - B. L1 (Manhattan)
   - C. L∞ (Chebyshev)
   - D. Angular distance

4) Why might we normalize vectors before using inner-product search for cosine similarity?
   - A. To reduce memory usage
   - B. To make inner product equal to cosine similarity
   - C. To avoid overflow in dot product
   - D. To convert to Hamming distance

5) True/False: Jaccard similarity is appropriate for dense real-valued embeddings.
