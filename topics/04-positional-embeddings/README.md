# Positional Embeddings

This unit covers absolute and relative positional representations, including the original Transformer sinusoidal embeddings, Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), and variants for 2D/3D data. You will learn the math, intuition, trade-offs, and how to visualize these mechanisms.
